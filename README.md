# LastOrdersApp

Description:
This project was completed as my final year project. The aim of this project was to design and develop an application that can be used to plan nights out in a new town/city in your current area, as in pubs, clubs, bars and events. The application is aimed for use on a cross-platform mobile application, while incorporating all local information around from mapping services from the Google Mapping API. Various Languages and technologies were used to develop this application such as Android Studio, Java, PHP, SQL, XML.
